Discussion of the application architecture:

This app was developed using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. React handles the client side of the application,
creating dynamic and responsive UI. The backend is ran by Node.js and Express.js, by processing client request and handling news app logic.
MongoDB is used as database that stores collections in JSON like format. The data flows from React frontend sending an HTTP request to the
Express server. Then, the server processes the request and perform data manipulations (save,delete,insert) with Mongoose, and sends back the response to the client side. For instance, when a user wants to save an article, the frontend sends an HTTP request to the backend API to insert the article data into the `ArticleModel` collection. Once the backend API successfully processes the request and returns a status 200, the article details are saved. The backend then sends a response back to the frontend, notifying the user that the article has been successfully added to their favorites table.
